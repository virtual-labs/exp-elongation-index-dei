### THEORY

The elongation index of an aggregate is the percentage by weight of particles whose greatest dimension (length) is greater than 1.8 times their mean dimension. It quantifies the proportion of needle-shaped or elongated particles in coarse aggregate samples.

**PURPOSE**

To assess the shape characteristics of coarse aggregates, ensuring optimal particle geometry for concrete workability, compaction efficiency, and structural performance in pavement and concrete construction.

**MECHANISM**

The test evaluates particle shape through dimensional comparison:

**1. Dimensional Analysis**
* Mean dimension represents average particle size for each sieve fraction
* Calculated as: **Mean Dimension = (Passing Sieve + Retaining Sieve) / 2**
* Critical length threshold = **1.8 × Mean Dimension**

**2. Elongation Criterion**
* Particles with **Length > 1.8 × Mean Dimension** classified as elongated
* Represents significant deviation from equidimensional geometry
* Factor of 1.8 based on empirical studies correlating shape with performance

**3. Mechanical Gauging**
* Length gauge slots sized at 1.8 times mean dimension for each fraction
* Elongated particles cannot pass through corresponding slot when longest dimension oriented along slot length
* Non-elongated particles pass freely regardless of orientation

**4. Physical Implications**

This assessment identifies particles that:
* Create bridging and arching during compaction
* Exhibit poor interlocking characteristics
* Require excessive matrix material for coating
* Demonstrate preferential fracture planes
* Reduce aggregate packing efficiency by 10-20%

### FORMULAS

**1. Individual Fraction Elongation Index**
```
Elongation Index of Fraction (%) = (Wₑ / Wₜ) × 100
```

Where:
* Wₑ = Weight of elongated particles retained on gauge (g)
* Wₜ = Total weight of fraction tested (g)

**2. Overall Elongation Index**
```
Overall Elongation Index (%) = (ΣWₑ / ΣWₜ) × 100
```

Where:
* ΣWₑ = Sum of elongated particles from all fractions (g)
* ΣWₜ = Total weight of all fractions tested (g)

**3. Weighted Average Method**
```
Weighted Elongation Index (%) = Σ(Pᵢ × Eᵢ) / 100
```

Where:
* Pᵢ = Percentage of each size fraction in original sample (%)
* Eᵢ = Elongation index of fraction i (%)

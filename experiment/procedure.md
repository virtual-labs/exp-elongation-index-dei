* Click on aggregate particles to pass through the gauge (arrow points to it).
* Click on the weighing balance to weigh passing aggregates (arrow points to it).
* Click the "Next Step" button.

Step 7:
* Click on the 10mm sieve to select retained aggregates (arrow points to it).
* Click on the 12.5-10mm slot in elongation gauge (arrow points to it).
* Click on aggregate particles to pass through the slot (arrow points to it).
* Click on the weighing balance to weigh passing aggregates (arrow points to it).
* Click on the 6.3mm sieve to select retained aggregates (arrow points to it).
